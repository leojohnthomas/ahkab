# Introduction #

There are quite a lot of things that it would be nice to add to the simulator. The following are the outstanding ones.

Patches implementing any of the following are very welcome.

My email is available from the [Project Home](http://code.google.com/p/ahkab/).

## Programming ##
  * ~~Sub-circuits support~~
  * Test suite
  * A proper netlist parser
  * Ability to extract internal parameters from devices (eg. M1.gm)

## Simulation ##
  * PSS of autonomous circuits
  * Non-linear capacitors and inductors
  * ~~AC analysis~~
  * ~~Symbolic solver~~
  * Transmission lines
  * More non-linear elements models: e.g. BJT
  * Parametric simulations
  * Monte Carlo simulations

## Post-processing ##
  * ~~Plotting~~
  * Fourier transform of the results
  * Evaluation of expression (eg GBWP)
  * Optimizer (LSQ based)

## Style ##
  * Code style
  * [Proper packaging](http://docs.python.org/dist/dist.html)
